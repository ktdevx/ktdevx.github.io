Hello, my name is Kaito Takemura.

I work as a systems engineer, mainly involved in embedded systems development. Since technology in the industry constantly evolves with the times, I always strive to keep learning so that I can apply new knowledge to my daily work.

I created this site in the hope that what I have learned as a systems engineer may be of help to others.
